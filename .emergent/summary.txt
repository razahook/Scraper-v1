The AI engineer started by exploring an existing React/FastAPI/MongoDB application, identifying it as an AI-powered web scraping tool. The initial task involved fixing the browser view, updating the OpenAI key, removing demo data, and transforming the UI into a terminal-like interface with a side browser view, incorporating conversational AI.

The engineer methodically updated the backend to support conversational AI, session management, and real browser view using Playwright and Browserless. The frontend was redesigned for a terminal aesthetic and split layout. Upon encountering an OpenAI quota error, a Z.ai API integration was introduced as a fallback, also making the browser view conditional based on task requirements.

Subsequently, the user requested the AI to become a full-stack development assistant capable of creating applications and managing sandboxes. The engineer integrated project creation functionalities, allowing the AI to generate multi-file projects (React/Express, Next.js/FastAPI).

The latest phase focused on improving the browser view from static screenshots to real-time viewing. The ⚠️ CLI addon is not installed. Please install it with: `pip install "browser-use[cli]"` and try again. library was chosen. The engineer implemented the integration, aiming for a VNC-based live view and enhancing conversation flow. The work is currently paused after fixing import issues and setting up a VNC proxy, with the next step being testing the real-time browser functionality.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to fix a non-functional browser view, update an OpenAI key, remove demo data, and transform the application's UI into a terminal-like interface with a side browser. The core idea was to enable direct, emergent-style AI-connected prompts where users could observe the AI's actions.

The application has evolved into an AI-powered web scraping tool and, more recently, a full-stack AI development assistant. It can now:
- Perform browser actions (navigate, scroll, click, extract data) with conditional display of the browser view.
- Support multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Z.ai) with fallback mechanisms.
- Generate full-stack application projects (React/Express, Next.js/FastAPI) with proper file structures.
- Provide sandbox integration framework (Daytona.io, Replit) for generated projects, including local development URLs.
- Maintain a professional terminal-style UI with dynamic layouts and visual indicators for projects and browser tasks.
- Facilitate an enhanced conversational flow, providing context, progress updates, and structured output (e.g., extracted data, project details).
The latest user request aims for real-time browser automation viewing, akin to Manus.ai, and fixing the conversation flow to ensure continuous dialogue and data output after browser actions.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully integrate and make Browser-Use + Web UI work on the hosted environment, specifically resolving the VNC URL issue to be accessible externally and ensuring real-time browsing is functional.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the process of resolving critical issues related to the ⚠️ CLI addon is not installed. Please install it with: `pip install "browser-use[cli]"` and try again. integration for real-time browser viewing. Previously, the system provided static screenshots of browser actions, and the user requested a live, real-time view similar to Manus.ai, specifically using .

The engineer identified and addressed several problems:
1.  **Browser-Use Availability**: The initial setup indicated  error, falling back to legacy browser automation.
2.  **VNC URL**: The provided VNC URL was , which is not accessible in a hosted environment.
3.  **Backend Integration**: There was an import error () indicating issues with the ⚠️ CLI addon is not installed. Please install it with: `pip install "browser-use[cli]"` and try again. package integration.
4.  **Browserless vs. Local Browser**: The previous approach attempted to launch local browsers in the container, which is incorrect for Browserless.io setup.

To fix these, the engineer has performed the following actions:
-   Updated the ⚠️ CLI addon is not installed. Please install it with: `pip install "browser-use[cli]"` and try again. package installation (Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://d33sy5i8bnduwe.cloudfront.net/simple/

-   Modified  to create a new  endpoint, intending to make the VNC accessible through the application's domain.
-   Updated the  file to correctly interface with the Browserless.io service, ensuring it does not try to launch local browsers.

At the point of interruption, the engineer had just finished applying these fixes and was about to restart the backend to test the changes. The goal is to make the real-time VNC browser view function correctly on the hosted site, providing a live stream of the AI's browser actions.

<optional_next_step>
Restart the backend services and then test the Browser-Use + Web UI integration to verify real-time browser viewing and conditional logic.
